ðŸ¦· Dental Problem Detection App ðŸ¦·

This repository contains the source code for a dental problem detection application developed using [insert programming languages/frameworks/libraries used]. The goal of this project is to provide users with a convenient tool for preliminary detection of common dental issues through image analysis and machine learning techniques.

Features:
Image Analysis: Utilizes computer vision algorithms to analyze dental images and identify potential problems such as cavities, gum disease, or dental abnormalities.
Machine Learning: Implements machine learning models trained on dental image datasets to classify and diagnose various dental conditions.
User-Friendly Interface: Offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users to upload dental images, receive diagnostic results, and access additional information about detected issues.
Scalability: Designed to be scalable and adaptable for integration with existing dental health systems or telemedicine platforms.
How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies as specified in the requirements.txt file.
Run the application and follow the instructions to upload dental images for analysis.
Receive diagnostic results and recommendations based on the analysis performed by the app.
Contributions:
Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether you're interested in improving the image analysis algorithms, enhancing the user interface, or expanding the dataset for better model accuracy, your contributions can help make dental healthcare more accessible and efficient.
